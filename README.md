# Process Synchronization

This programming exercise will assess your understanding of process synchronization.

## Problem Statement

Consider the following synchronization problem:

Suppose you are tasked to create a solution that will manage the number of people inside a department store fitting room. Here are some constraints:

- There are only n slots inside the fitting room of a department store. Thus, there can only be at most n persons inside the fitting room at a time.
- There cannot be a mix of blue and green in the fitting room at the same time. Thus, there can only be at most n blue threads or at most n green threads inside the fitting room at a time.
- The solution should not result in deadlock.
- The solution should not result in starvation. For example, blue threads cannot forever be blocked from entering the fitting room if green threads are lining up to enter as well.

Task: Coordinate between blue and green threads.

## Input

The program accepts three inputs from the user.

- `n` – the number of slots inside the fitting room
- `b` – number of blue threads
- `g` – number of green threads

## Output

The output of the program should be a simulation that includes the following:

- When a blue thread is the first to enter an empty fitting room, the thread should print the string “Blue only.”
- When a green thread is the first to enter an empty fitting room, the thread should print the string “Green only.”
- When a thread enters the fitting room, the thread should print its thread ID and color (i.e., blue or green).
- When a thread is the last to exit the fitting room, the thread should print the string “Empty fitting room.”

## Required Program Interaction

There should be minimal program interaction. The program will ask the user to input the values for `n`, `b`, and `g`.
